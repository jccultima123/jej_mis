# jejMIS 0.6.2 WIP
## #WorkInProgress

jejMIS is heavily modified PHP MVC pattern from [MINI](http://www.php-mini.com) and [PHP-LOGIN](http://www.php-login.net/).
for JEJ Cellmania Trading Corporation

## NOTES (Except Academic Objectives)

- Technical Objective to this project is to overcome the [Spaghetti Code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaghetti_code) method
- This project has technically no framework like Symphony, Laravel, etc.
  It barely uses pure PHP syntax thru functions, arrays, loops and constructors although we have third-party libraries.
- The composer is a third-party PHP dependency that installs third-party libraries properly without code mess.
- This project is based on the scopes and limitations of my current CAPSTONE project.

## Requirements

- Apache Server 2.4.*+
- PHP 5.3.7+
- PHP PECL/FileInfo Extension must be enabled in PHP ini (extension=php_fileinfo.dll)
- Composer (PHP Dependency Manager, required for installing 3rd party class)
- MySQL 5.6.*+
- Apache's 'mod_rewrite' must be activated
- Any Browsers with HTML5 (Firefox 33+, Internet Explorer 9+ (Still, IE9+ is partially supported but expected decos like animations are not supported), Chrome, Safari, Opera (more bugs), etc.)
- Your database **(Must Configured in config.php and model/*_model.php!)**
