# jejMIS 0.5.2

jejMIS is heavily modified PHP MVC pattern from [MINI](http://www.php-mini.com) and [PHP-LOGIN](http://www.php-login.net/).

## NOTES (Except Academic Objectives)

- Main Objective to this project is to avoid [Spaghetti Code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaghetti_code) method
- This project has technically no framework like Symphony, Laravel, etc.
  It barely uses pure PHP syntax thru functions, arrays, loops and constructors although we have third-party libraries but for user interfaces only.
- The composer is a third-party PHP dependency that installs third-party libraries properly without code mess.
- This project is based on the scopes and limitations of my current CAPSTONE project. But you can grab a copy of it and modify actions for your projects.

## Requirements

- Apache Server 2.4.*+
- PHP 5.3.7+
- MySQL 5.6.*+
- Apache's 'mod_rewrite' must be activated
- Any Browsers (Firefox 33+, Internet Explorer 9+ (8 maybe?), Chrome, Safari, Opera (more bugs), etc.)
- Your database **(Must Configured in config.php and model/*_model.php!)**
