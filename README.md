# jejMIS

jejMIS is heavily Modified from [MINI](http://www.php-mini.com) and [PHP-LOGIN](http://www.php-login.net/) for my CAPSTONE project.

NOTES:
- This project is based on the scopes and limitations of my course projects. If you want to include change and register actions, you can modify or add codes from php-login repository.
- Internet Explorer already ended the lifespan/support from Microsoft which is it will occur security conflicts and attacks.

## Requirements

- Apache Server 2.4.*+
- PHP 5.3.7+
- MySQL 5.6.*+
- Apache's 'mod_rewrite' must be activated
- Any Browsers.
- Your database **(Must Configured in config.php and model/*_model.php!)**

## REMINDER / DISCLAIMER

This system is only for educational purposes. You can obtain it but there will be no database on this repo.
So, you should have already one.
